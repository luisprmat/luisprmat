I'm a Colombian mathematician of [Universidad Nacional de Colombia](https://unal.edu.co).

I like *programming* specially **web develop**. I use several technologies and languages for my projects and everyday i'm writing code and learning new tips.

In the *Backend* I use

- PHP with [Laravel Framework](https://laravel.com/) and its different official and third-party packages.
- Node.js with [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/) and other Frameworks like [Adonis.js](https://adonisjs.com/) (*learning in progress*), this last one likes me because of its resemblance to **Laravel**

In the *Frontend* I use

- The basics (HTML, CSS, JS)
- [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/)
- I use CSS Frameworks like [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) and *i'm learning* [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) now powered by **Laravel**

I am currently studying mobile application development with **Android** (Java 8+)


## Contributions
In my spare time I like contribute to *open-source* packages like:
- [Laravel Lang](https://github.com/Laravel-Lang/lang) - Translations for the Laravel Framework and its official packages. I help to maintain the Laravel translations to Spanish
- [Laravel Jetstream](https://github.com/laravel/jetstream) - Laravel Jetstream is a beautifully designed application scaffolding for Laravel
